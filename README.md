This is a game I made to have fun with friends. It is NOT meant for public use.
It's a 2D ping pong/table tennis game called Isopong (isometric/ping-pong = iso/pong = isopong). Inspired by the ping pong minigame from Google Doodle Chamion Island.
You can go ahead and play it instead of me having to explain everything. Bye!
